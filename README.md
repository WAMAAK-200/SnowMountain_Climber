# SnowMountain_Climber
This was made as part of an 8 hour winter game jam

The topics were:
- Arctic
- Huddle
- Snow

Although I ran out of time to finish it during the Game Jam, I plan on finishing this project, to include the sprites that I had created for it. As well as to overall expand this project to include an automatically sidescrolling camera.
